"""Integration tests against locally built parquets (skip if absent).

Stress-tests `TcgaHfPatient.model_validate` over every patient row in every
project parquet, then exercises the timeline + consistency_check methods
across the cohort. Several of these tests assert the *presence* of a known
GDC quirk (sample collections post-dating death), which means if GDC ever
fixes the underlying anchor inconsistency, those tests will fail and we'll
know to update our docs.

Run only these:                  uv run pytest -m integration
Skip these in regular runs:      uv run pytest -m "not integration"
