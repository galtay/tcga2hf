"""Section 4 — Per-project survival landscape (numerical analog of Liu's Figure 1B-E).

Liu's Figure 1B-E showed Kaplan-Meier curves of OS / PFI / DFI / DSS for
each of the 33 tumor types overlaid on one axes per endpoint. We don't
ship figures in this report; instead we surface the same information as
event-counts plus survival rates at clinically meaningful timepoints
(1-year, 3-year, 5-year). Aggressive cancers (SKCM, OV, GBM, MESO) drop
fast; indolent cancers (TGCT, PRAD, THCA, KICH) stay flat — same pattern
the K-M panels showed visually.

Computed against our **re-derived** endpoints on the full current cohort
(11,428 patients). Tumor types Liu marks as having no usable signal for
an endpoint (e.g. SKCM/THYM/UVM/LAML for DFI) are omitted from that
column.

## Section 4 — Per-project survival landscape

Liu's Figure 1B-E shows Kaplan-Meier curves per project for each endpoint. We surface the same information as event counts plus survival probabilities at 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year timepoints — the standard clinical reporting milestones. The same patterns Liu's panels show visually appear here numerically: aggressive cancers (SKCM, OV, GBM, MESO) drop fast; indolent cancers (TGCT, PRAD, THCA, KICH) stay flat.

Computed against our re-derived `{{os,dss,pfi,dfi}}_event/_time` columns on the full current cohort (11,428 patients). `—` means insufficient follow-up to estimate the rate at that timepoint (curve hasn't reached it). Projects with zero populated patients for an endpoint (e.g. LAML / SKCM / THYM / UVM for DFI — Liu's exclusions) are omitted from that table.

### OS — Overall Survival

{os_table}

### PFI — Progression-Free Interval

{pfi_table}

### DFI — Disease-Free Interval

{dfi_table}

### DSS — Disease-Specific Survival

{dss_table}

### Reading the tables

- **N (populated)** — patients with both event and time populated for that endpoint. For DFI especially this is much smaller than the project N (most patients lack a disease-free signal at end of first course; see Section 9 deep-dive).
- **events** — count of `event=1` patients in the populated subset.
- **1-yr / 3-yr / 5-yr** — Kaplan-Meier survival probability at that timepoint, accounting for right-censoring. `—` flags projects whose follow-up is shorter than the timepoint (e.g. mostly post-2018 cases).
- **OS vs DSS** — DSS censors cancer-unrelated deaths, so DSS rates are equal to or higher than OS rates at the same timepoint within a project.
- **OS vs PFI** — PFI events are generally earlier than OS events (Liu: *"PFI is generally considered a more informative endpoint"*); PFI rates at 1-year are typically lower than OS rates at 1-year.

### Cross-reference to Liu's reliability assessment

Liu's Table 3 marks each (project, endpoint) as recommended / acceptable / not recommended based on event count and assumption tests. The N-populated column above is the relevant input — projects with very low N for an endpoint don't pass Liu's reliability bar. See the original paper Table 3 for the per-cell recommendations; we don't reproduce that here because it's an editorial overlay rather than a reproducible computation.
