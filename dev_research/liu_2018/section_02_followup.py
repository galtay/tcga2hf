"""Section 2 — Median follow-up times (Liu's Table 2).

Liu's Table 2 reports per-project median follow-up time plus median
time-to-event and time-to-censor for each of the four endpoints, all in
months (days / 30.44). The CDR workbook ships per-patient OS/DSS/PFI/DFI
event flags and times, so we can:

  1. Aggregate the CDR workbook to reproduce Liu's Table 2 (algorithm
     sanity check).
  2. Aggregate our re-derived endpoints over the matched cohort and
     compare against the CDR aggregation (drift signal).
  3. Show our re-derived medians on the full current cohort (extension
     coverage).

Cell-match rule: ±0.5 month tolerance on each median. Liu reports to one
decimal; ±0.5 months covers the rounding noise + one or two patients
shifting position around the median.

## Section 2 — Median follow-up times (Liu's Table 2)

Liu's Table 2 reports per-project median follow-up plus median time-to-event and time-to-censor for each of OS / PFI / DFI / DSS, all in months (`days / 30.44`). The CDR workbook ships the per-patient event flags and time values Liu used; aggregating those reproduces Liu's published Table 2 to {paper_pct}% ({paper_match}/{paper_total} cells), with the {paper_n_off} differences in low-count cells where one or two patients shift the median.

### Cell-match rule

Each cell is a median in months. We treat two cells as equal if they're within **±0.5 months**. Liu reports to one decimal; ±0.5 covers rounding noise and one-or-two-patient shifts around the median position. NA matches NA.

### Modern GDC vs Liu CDR — same 11,160 patients

This is the primary drift signal. Same patients, two data sources (modern-GDC re-derived endpoints vs Liu's 2018 CDR-workbook values). Mismatches are post-2018 re-curation showing up in the median: patients whose vital status, follow-up, or recurrence dates have been updated.

#### Per-field match rate

{summary_drift}

#### Mismatching cells

{mismatches_drift}

### Sanity — CDR-aggregated reproduces Liu's published Table 2

This confirms our aggregation logic before the drift comparison above is interpretable.

#### Per-field match rate

{summary_paper}

#### Mismatching cells

{mismatches_paper}

### Our re-derived Table 2 on the full current cohort (11,428)

Includes the 268 post-freeze patients. Useful for picking the most-currently-informative project per endpoint.

{table2_full}

### Notable findings

- **Bucketing logic is sound.** The CDR-aggregated reconstruction matches Liu's paper Table 2 at {paper_pct}%; remaining differences are sub-patient median shifts in low-count cells.
- **Median follow-up has grown by ~1-12 months for several projects.** SKCM, BRCA, KIRC, OV all show longer median follow-up in the modern GDC than Liu had in 2018 — patients who were censored in 2018 have either had more follow-up visits or eventually died.
- **DFI medians are the noisiest.** Same structural reason as Section 1 stage NA collapse: the underlying `treatment_outcome_first_course` field has shifted population over time. DLBC's 113.7 month DFI-to-event in Liu (one or two patients) drops in our re-derivation because we no longer have those patients populated for DFI.
- **Our re-derived DFI populates fewer cells than Liu's CDR.** A handful of (project, DFI) entries are NA in our re-derivation but populated in Liu's. Section 9 deep-dives this.

### Confidence in the drift attribution

Same as Section 1: the CDR workbook ships per-patient values, so the cell-level differences here are real per-patient changes rather than aggregation issues. Without a versioned 2018 GDC clinical snapshot we can't always attribute each change to (a) modern GDC re-curation vs (b) Liu hand-fix that didn't round-trip — but in aggregate, modern GDC consistently has more populated, more-recent values.
