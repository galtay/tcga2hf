## Section 6 — OS deep-dive (98% match — data drift only)

OS is the simplest endpoint to derive (death from any cause; no tumor-status or new-tumor-event reasoning). Algorithmic agreement with Liu is essentially perfect; the 2% mismatch is data drift between Liu's 2018 freeze and the modern GDC.

### Mismatch direction

{direction_table}

The asymmetry is telling: every event mismatch goes in the **same direction** — Liu had `OS=0` (alive) and we now have `OS=1` (dead). These are patients who were alive at Liu's 2018 freeze and have since died.

### Per-project event mismatches

{per_project_table}

### Sample of named patients

Patients alive in Liu's CDR, dead in modern GDC. These are individually traceable on the GDC Data Portal — useful for spot-checking.

{sample_table}

### Implication

OS data drift is the *single most concrete* evidence that audit-grade reproducibility against Liu requires comparing against the frozen CDR (`cdr_*` columns), not against the modern GDC. For a survival cohort that includes vital-status updates since 2018, use the re-derived `os_event` / `os_time` columns; you'll get more recent and more accurate vital status, but won't bit-match Liu's 2018 numbers.

For exact Liu reproduction: filter to `cdr_matched == True` and use `cdr_OS` / `cdr_OS_time`.
