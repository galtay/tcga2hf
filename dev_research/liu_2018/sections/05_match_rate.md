## Section 5 — Match rate against Liu's curated CDR

For the 11,160 CDR-matched patients, how often does our re-derived value exactly match Liu's? Five-category classification per (patient, endpoint):

- **match** — both populated, event and time both equal (within 0.5 days)
- **mismatch** — both populated but disagree
- **both NA** — both NA (e.g. SKCM has no DFI in either stream)
- **Liu only** (`cdr_pop_der_na`) — Liu populated, ours is NA (we under-populate)
- **ours only** (`der_pop_cdr_na`) — ours populated, Liu's is NA (we over-populate, or filling a post-hoc gap)

### Cohort-level summary

| endpoint | total | match | match % | mismatch | both NA | Liu only (cdr_pop_der_na) | ours only (der_pop_cdr_na) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OS | 11160 | 10938 | 98.0 | 163 | 3 | 50 | 6 |
| DSS | 11160 | 10373 | 92.9 | 240 | 18 | 35 | 494 |
| PFI | 11160 | 10720 | 96.1 | 193 | 13 | 40 | 194 |
| DFI | 11160 | 5415 | 48.5 | 64 | 4640 | 52 | 989 |

### Per-project per-endpoint match rate

Denominator is patients where Liu's CDR populated the endpoint (excludes the both-NA cases). Numerator is exact matches. Mismatches and Liu-only cases count against the rate. `—` means Liu populated zero patients for that (project, endpoint) — typically Liu's documented exclusions (LAML for DSS/PFI/DFI; SKCM/THYM/UVM for DFI).

### Reading the cohort summary

The "match" column above counts only exact agreement (event + time within 0.5 days), which under-counts DFI by penalizing the ~4,640 patients we both correctly exclude. A more honest "we got pretty much the same answer" rate counts both-NA as agreement and allows ~30 days of time slack on populated cases:

| endpoint | agreement rate (both NA OR both populated within 30d) |
|---|---|
| OS  | **98.2%** (10,961/11,160) |
| DSS | **93.2%** (10,400/11,160) |
| PFI | **96.3%** (10,747/11,160) |
| DFI | **90.1%** (10,055/11,160) |

For DFI specifically, this is up from **77.2%** before the BCR biotab Clinical Supplement integration (a +12.9 percentage-point jump from one upstream change). See Section 9 for the per-bucket breakdown of the remaining 10% disagreement.

### Per-endpoint notes

- **OS** — algorithmic agreement is essentially perfect; the 2% disagreement is patients alive in Liu's 2018 freeze who have since died (data drift, not algorithm). See Section 6 deep-dive.
- **DSS** — Liu's own STAR Methods flags DSS as approximate (*"not a 100% accurate definition but is the best we could do with this dataset"*). Our re-derivation honors the same rule. See Section 7.
- **PFI** — past Liu's reliability bar of 95%. Most disagreement is post-2018 follow-up time shifting (longer censor times). See Section 8.
- **DFI** — at 90% agreement, the remaining 10% is mostly the 989 patients where we have **extra coverage** Liu didn't have in 2018 (we found a disease-free signal in the BCR biotab Liu's 2018 algorithm couldn't compute), plus 64 outright disagreements and 52 patients where Liu had a value we still can't recover. See Section 9.

### Reading the per-project table

- **High-match projects** (most cells ≥95%): smaller cohorts where the data has stabilized and Liu's exclusions match ours.
- **Low-DFI-match projects**: GBM (mostly all stage IV → DFI excluded by Liu's stage-IV rule), DLBC (small cohort, fragile to per-patient drift), KICH/KIRC/KIRP (the kidney trio, where biotab data is sparser than other tumor types).
- **`—` cells**: SKCM/THYM/UVM/LAML for DFI, LAML for DSS/PFI — Liu's documented exclusions; we honor the same rule so denominator is zero.

The remaining sections walk through OS / DSS / PFI / DFI individually.
