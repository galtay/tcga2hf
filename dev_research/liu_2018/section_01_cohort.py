"""Section 1 — Cohort characteristics (Liu's Table 1).

The CDR workbook ships per-patient values for every Table 1 field
(`age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis`, `gender`, `race`,
`ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage`, `clinical_stage`, `histological_grade`).
Aggregating those values reproduces Liu's published Table 1 — so we use
the CDR workbook directly as ground truth for the modern-GDC comparison,
rather than parsing per-cell values from the PDF.

Two views, in this order:

  1. **Modern GDC vs Liu CDR (same 11,160 patients)** — the primary
     drift signal. Same patients, two data sources.
  2. **Cohort growth** — what the modern GDC has that Liu's 2018 freeze
     didn't (268 post-freeze patients, project breakdown).

A small sanity check at the top confirms the CDR workbook reproduces the
paper Table 1 (5 cells off out of 198, all Liu paper-vs-workbook drift,
not our bucketing).

Liu-documented overrides applied on the modern-GDC side:

  - **Age** — Liu reported integer (floor) ages.
  - **ACC stage** — ENSAT staging in the fallback chain.
  - **BLCA grade** — `Low Grade` -> G1, `High Grade` -> G3.
  - **UCEC grade** — `High Grade` -> G3.
  - **GBM grade** — every patient set to G4.
  - **SKCM stage** — earliest stage-bearing diagnosis, not the
    `is_primary=True` (metastatic) one.

## Section 1 — Cohort characteristics (Liu's Table 1)

Liu's Table 1 lists per-project counts, mean age, gender breakdown, race breakdown, AJCC stage, and tumor grade for the 11,160-patient cohort. The CDR workbook (`TCGA-CDR-SupplementalTableS1.xlsx`) ships the per-patient values Liu used to make Table 1: `age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis`, `gender`, `race`, `ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage`, `clinical_stage`, `histological_grade`. So we use the CDR workbook directly as ground truth — aggregating it reproduces Liu's published Table 1 to {paper_match_pct}% ({paper_match}/{paper_total} cells); the {paper_n_off} differences are Liu paper-vs-workbook drift (HNSC and a handful of others have more stage-NAs in the paper than in the released workbook), not our bucketing.

### Per-patient age verification

Modern GDC ships `demographic.days_to_birth` (negative integer = days from birth to index date); Liu's CDR ships `age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis` (integer years). For the {age_n} CDR-matched patients with both populated, our computed `floor(-days_to_birth / 365.25)` matches Liu's recorded age:

- **Exact match**: {age_exact}/{age_n} ({age_exact_pct}%)
- **Within ±1 year**: {age_pm1}/{age_n} ({age_pm1_pct}%)

The 92 off-by-1 cases all have `days_to_diagnosis=0` (so it isn't a missing offset). They reflect the fact that `age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis` is an independently-recorded BCR field, not a derivation of `days_to_birth` — institutions occasionally disagree by a year due to "age last birthday" vs floor-of-fraction conventions. The 99% per-patient agreement is the strongest available evidence that our age formula matches Liu's intent.

### Liu-documented overrides applied on the modern-GDC side

These are the rules Liu describes in their paper and footnotes — without them, the modern-GDC reproduction can't match Liu's table even in principle.

- **Age** — Liu reported integer (floor) ages. The CDR workbook confirms: `age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis` ships as integer floats (58.0, 44.0, ...).
- **ACC stage** — Liu reported AJCC for ACC in 2018; modern GDC has migrated ACC to ENSAT. We add `ensat_pathologic_stage` to the fallback chain.
- **BLCA grade** — Liu's footnote: *"In BLCA, G1 was for 'low grade' and G3 for 'high grade' in this table."* We apply the remap.
- **UCEC grade** — Liu's footnote: *"UCEC had 11 high grade, which was converted to G3."* Same remap.
- **GBM grade** — Liu's footnote: *"GBM is grade IV by definition. In the original TCGA dataset, the grades for GBM cases were not provided."* Hand-set to G4.
- **SKCM stage** — Liu's STAR Methods footnote f: SKCM tumors were sampled mostly from regional/distant metastases, but Liu reported the *initial* (non-metastatic) diagnosis stage. In modern GDC, the `diagnosis_is_primary_disease=True` row is the metastatic Progression record (without a stage value); the original-diagnosis stage lives on the earliest diagnosis row. We pick that earliest stage-bearing diagnosis for SKCM only.

### Modern GDC vs Liu CDR — same 11,160 patients

This is the primary drift signal: the 11,160 patients in Liu's CDR cohort, computed from current GDC data on the left vs Liu's 2018 CDR-workbook values on the right. Mismatches are post-2018 re-curation: the same patient has a different value today than Liu had in 2018.

Cell-match rule: strict string equality, except **Age** uses a ±1 year tolerance on the cohort mean. Since `age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis` and `days_to_birth` are independently recorded BCR fields and disagree by 1 year for ~1% of patients (per the verification above), the resulting cohort-mean difference is sub-degree and not meaningful drift.

#### Per-field match rate

{summary_drift}

#### Mismatching cells

{mismatches_drift}

### Cohort growth — what's new since Liu's 2018 freeze

The modern GDC has 11,428 patients across 33 projects, +268 over Liu's 11,160. The growth is concentrated in a few projects.

{growth_table}

### Our reproduced Table 1 (full current cohort, 11,428 patients)

{table1_full}

### Notable findings

- **Bucketing logic is sound.** The CDR-workbook reconstruction matches Liu's paper Table 1 at {paper_match_pct}%; remaining differences are within Liu's own paper-vs-workbook updates (HNSC's 75 stage-NA in the paper vs 0 in the workbook is the largest single example).
- **PRAD race is the most extreme drift case.** Liu CDR has `147/7/2/344` (344 NA) for PRAD; the same 500 patients now read `415/58/13/14` in the modern GDC — most of the 344 NAs have been back-filled to specific racial categories.
- **Stage NA counts have collapsed broadly.** ESCA, KIRP, CESC, and others have 5-15 fewer NA cases in modern GDC than in Liu's CDR. Modern GDC is more populated.
- **Age, gender, grade are nearly stable.** The only grade drift is BLCA (one patient flipped G3 -> NA). Gender matches everywhere. Age means agree to within ±0.2 years on the matched cohort.
- **Cohort growth is concentrated.** Most projects unchanged in N; the +268 patients are 48% TGCT, 24% LUAD, with smaller additions elsewhere.

### Confidence in the drift attribution

We can verify Table 1 fields per-patient now (the CDR workbook ships every patient's value), which gives us a strong signal that the cell-count differences in the table above are real per-patient changes, not aggregation differences. What we can't easily disentangle is the *cause* of each change: the GDC may have re-curated the value, or Liu may have hand-corrected it in 2018 in a way that didn't round-trip back to the GDC dictionary. Without a versioned 2018 GDC clinical snapshot we can only say "the value in the CDR is X today's GDC says Y" — not which side is closer to the source-of-truth. The infrastructure to fetch and pin a 2018 GDC snapshot exists in the pipeline (`gdc_status.json` + dictionary capture); adding it is future work.
