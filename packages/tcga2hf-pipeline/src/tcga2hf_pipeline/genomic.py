"""Generic open-access GDC file fetcher for genomic / molecular data.

Mutations and expression (and miRNA, copy number, etc. later) all share the same
shape: query /files with a project + data_type filter, download each hit's bytes,
and write a manifest mapping file_id -> case_submitter_id + sample info. The
patient-row build step can join on those FKs later — we keep raw downloads and
manifest separate so iteration on the schema doesn't trigger re-downloads.
