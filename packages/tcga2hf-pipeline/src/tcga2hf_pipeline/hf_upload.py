    The directory should contain README.md (with `configs:` YAML frontmatter)

    `tcga2hf-pipeline build`.

    `delete_patterns` lets the upload remove existing files in the remote
    repo that match a glob (e.g. `["*/train.parquet"]` when migrating away
    from an old layout). Files are deleted as part of the same commit as the
    upload, so the repo never appears in a half-migrated state.

    Auth: pass `token` explicitly, or set HF_TOKEN, or run `huggingface-cli login`
    first. Returns the URL of the dataset on success.
