"""single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA), transcribed from Bioconductor GSVA.

Pathway activity per RNA-Seq aliquot: expression in, one score per gene set
out. Barbie et al. 2009's method as implemented by GSVA's `ssgsea.R`.

## Why a Python transcription rather than calling GSVA

The canonical implementation is R. Rather than make Bioconductor a pipeline
dependency, this module reproduces it and is validated against it: on a
100-sample × 19,938-gene TCGA matrix scored with MSigDB Hallmark, agreement
with GSVA 2.6.6 is Pearson/Spearman 1.0000000000, max *relative* difference
4.8e-13 (raw) and 6.0e-13 (normalized), with identical pathway ordering in
100/100 samples. Residuals are float64 summation-order noise. The R side is
kept as an offline oracle under `dev_research/ssgsea/`, in the same spirit
as the Liu 2018 CDR validation.

## The algorithm

For each sample independently:

    R    = integer rank of expression within the sample. GSVA computes
           `as.integer(rank(x))` — average ties, then truncate toward zero.
    ord  = genes ordered by decreasing rank (highest expressed first)
    in   = cumsum(R[ord]^alpha * inSet) / sum(R[ord]^alpha * inSet)
    out  = cumsum(!inSet) / sum(!inSet)
    ES   = sum(in - out)

`alpha` weights the walk by **rank**, not by expression. A consequence
worth knowing: any strictly monotonic transform of expression leaves ranks —
and therefore scores — bit-identical, so ssGSEA(TPM) == ssGSEA(log1p(TPM)).
There is no reason to log-transform before scoring.

## Normalization is deliberately separate

GSVA's `normalize=TRUE` divides every score by the range of the *entire*
score matrix. That is a single global scalar, so it is exactly decomposable
across chunks — but it also makes each score depend on the cohort and the
gene-set collection it was computed alongside, not on the sample alone.
Adding MSigDB Reactome to a Hallmark run widens the divisor by ~49% on TCGA
data, silently rescaling every previously published Hallmark value.

So `ssgsea_scores` returns raw scores, and `normalize_global` returns the
divisor alongside the normalized values. Publish the raw score and the
divisor; the normalized view is then reconstructable, while the reverse is
not.
