"""MSigDB gene-set collections (GMT), fetched and md5-pinned.

Companion to `ssgsea.py`, which consumes these sets. Same handling as the
Liu CDR workbook in `cdr.py`: download once into `<data-dir>/raw/msigdb/`,
verify against the hash we tested with, and surface a mismatch rather than
silently consuming new bytes.

Pinning matters more here than usual. MSigDB re-releases regularly (the
collections are curated, so set membership genuinely changes between
versions), and gene-set membership feeds straight into every score. A
dataset that says "ssGSEA of Hallmark" without naming the release is not
reproducible.

Only collections we can redistribute scores from are listed. MSigDB is
CC BY 4.0, but some constituent collections carry extra restrictions —
notably the KEGG-derived sets — which are therefore absent.

Which of the listed collections are actually scored is `SSGSEA_COLLECTIONS`
in `tcga2hf.schema`, not this dict: WikiPathways is fetchable and pinned
here but deliberately not scored (see its entry below).
