"""Re-derive Liu et al. 2018 CDR survival endpoints from the live GDC data.

Companion to `cdr.py`: where `cdr.attach_cdr` lifts curated values from
Liu's frozen 2018 workbook, this module re-computes the same four
endpoints (OS, DSS, DFI, PFI) from the patient row's clinical structure
using Liu's documented algorithm. The two streams together let us:

  1. Validate the pipeline by comparing re-derived values to CDR for the
     ~11,160 patients Liu covers, and
  2. Extend coverage to the ~268 post-2018-freeze patients CDR can't reach.

## Liu's algorithm (verbatim, from the TCGA-CDR_Notes sheet)

  - **OS**: 1 for death from any cause, 0 for alive.
    OS.time: last_contact_days_to or death_days_to, whichever is larger.

  - **DSS**: 1 for `vital_status == Dead AND tumor_status == WITH TUMOR`,
    or `cause_of_death` indicates the cancer; 0 for Alive or
    `Dead AND tumor_status == TUMOR FREE`. Else NA.
    DSS.time: same as OS.time.

  - **DFI**: 1 for new tumor event (recurrence/metastasis/new primary,
    including type N/A). Disease-free at end of first course is required:
    `treatment_outcome_first_course == "Complete Remission/Response"`,
    falling back to `residual_tumor == "R0"` for tumor types without
    that field, falling back to `margin_status == "negative"` for those
    without either. Tumor types with none of the three: DFI is NA.
    "New primary in other organ" is censored, not an event. Stage IV
    excluded; dead-with-tumor-no-event excluded. 0 for censored otherwise.
    DFI.time: new_tumor_event_dx_days_to for events, else
    last_contact_days_to or death_days_to (whichever applies).

  - **PFI**: 1 for new tumor event (any kind, including type N/A) OR
    Dead-with-cancer-without-new-tumor-event. 0 for censored otherwise.
    PFI.time: new_tumor_event_dx_days_to or death_days_to for events;
    last_contact_days_to or death_days_to for censored.

## Field mapping (Liu's old TCGA name -> modern GDC path in our schema)

  - vital_status                       demographic.vital_status
  - death_days_to                      demographic.days_to_death
  - cause_of_death                     demographic.cause_of_death
  - last_contact_days_to               max(diagnoses[primary].days_to_last_follow_up,
                                            max(follow_ups[].days_to_follow_up))
  - tumor_status                       latest non-null follow_ups[].disease_response,
                                            mapped 'WT-With Tumor' -> WITH TUMOR,
                                            'TF-Tumor Free' -> TUMOR FREE
  - new_tumor_event_dx_days_to         min(populated follow_ups[].days_to_recurrence
                                            or .days_to_progression)
  - new_tumor_event_type               follow_ups[].progression_or_recurrence_type
                                            at the earliest event
  - treatment_outcome_first_course     diagnoses[primary].treatments[0].treatment_outcome
                                            (treatments pre-sorted by days_to_treatment_start)
  - residual_tumor (Liu) ->
      residual_disease (modern GDC)    diagnoses[primary].residual_disease
  - margin_status                      diagnoses[primary].treatments[].margin_status
                                            (lives on TREATMENT_FIELDS, not DIAGNOSIS_FIELDS)
  - Stage IV check                     diagnoses[primary].ajcc_pathologic_stage starts "Stage IV"

The "primary diagnosis" is the one with `diagnosis_is_primary_disease == True`,
falling back to the earliest by `days_to_diagnosis` if none is flagged.

## DFI tumor-type special cases

  - no DFI available:          SKCM, THYM, UVM, LAML
  - SARC: residual_disease only (Liu chose it over margin_status when both
                                  populated; clinically the right field for
                                  end-of-first-course assessment)
  - all other tumor types: disease-free is the OR of `treatment_outcome ==
    "Complete Response"`, `residual_disease == "R0"`, or
    `margin_status == "Uninvolved"`. Liu's STAR Methods is explicit about
    this being an OR — three independent signals, any one suffices. Earlier
    drafts of this module implemented a per-tumor-type chain instead, which
    over-excluded patients with a positive signal in a non-primary field.
