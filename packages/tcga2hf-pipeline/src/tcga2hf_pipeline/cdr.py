"""Liu et al., Cell 2018 — TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (CDR).

Curated survival endpoints (OS, DSS, DFI, PFI) for the TCGA cohort, frozen
at the 2018 data freeze. The file is hosted on the GDC's PanCanAtlas
auxiliary distribution under a stable UUID — fetchable via
`POST/GET /data/<uuid>` but **not indexed by `/files`**, so we don't go
through `genomic.fetch_files`. We download once into
`<data-dir>/raw/cdr/` and validate the md5 against the snapshot we tested
against.

The workbook has 8 sheets; only `TCGA-CDR` (the headline curated table)
is used. The sheet is keyed by `bcr_patient_barcode`, which equals our
`case_submitter_id`. Cases added to the GDC after Liu's 2018 freeze are
absent — `attach_cdr` flags those as `cdr_matched=False` rather than
silently dropping.
