## Data model

### Where the data comes from

Three sources feed each project's data, all open-access:

- **Case-level clinical structure** — fetched from the GDC `/cases`
  endpoint, returning the full nested case JSON (demographic + diagnoses
  → treatments + follow_ups + exposures + family_histories + samples →
  portions → analytes → aliquots). The biospecimen subtree on each case:

  ```
  case          one patient (TCGA-XX-1234)
  └── sample    physical specimen taken from the patient at one timepoint
                (Primary Tumor, Solid Tissue Normal, Blood Derived Normal, ...)
      └── portion    a piece of that sample for a specific lab process
          └── analyte    extracted material of one type (DNA or RNA)
              └── aliquot    a vial of that analyte handed off for sequencing
  ```

- **Per-modality files** — discovered via `/files` (filtered by the
  clauses in the table below) and downloaded via `/data`. Each
  combination locks one `data_type` to a specific GDC pipeline so a
  future GDC addition can't quietly substitute a different pipeline
  under the same `data_type`. This covers both the molecular modalities
  and the scanned Pathology Report PDFs, which are carried verbatim —
  no text extraction is applied, so consumers can run whichever parser
  they trust against the original document.
- **BCR Clinical Supplement biotabs** — original Biospecimen Core
  Resource (BCR) clinical forms shipped as per-project TSVs (one per
  form: patient, follow_up, nte, drug, radiation, etc.). The harmonized
  `/cases` endpoint drops or under-populates a number of clinical fields
  the BCR-original biotabs preserve. The schema varies by cancer type
  (e.g. BLCA's BCG-response columns don't exist in CHOL's hepatic-marker
  forms), so each project's biotabs ship only the columns they actually
  carry. Discovered the same way (`/files` then `/data`) — see the
  filter table below.

### Source data filters (canonical)

Same in both views of the dataset; each row locks the `/files` query
for one source:

## Survival endpoints (`survival_derived`)

We have provided a supplement to the GDC source data: re-derived
survival endpoints — Overall Survival (OS), Disease-Specific Survival
(DSS), Progression-Free Interval (PFI), Disease-Free Interval (DFI) —
following the algorithm published by **Liu et al. 2018**
([DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.052](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.052)).

{location} `*_event` is 0/1 (event observed vs censored); `*_time` is
days from `index_date` (TCGA: diagnosis date). DFI is null for SKCM /
THYM / UVM / LAML — Liu specifies no DFI for those tumor types.

We've reimplemented Liu's method against the current TCGA data and find
broad agreement with the original curated CDR. Differences exist and are
expected: this is a newer release of the underlying GDC data, so
re-curated clinical values, post-2018 patient additions, and schema
migrations all contribute to the gap. This work is evolving; see the
[repository][repo] for the full reproduction report and per-endpoint
methodology.

**Why we don't ship Liu's curated 2018 values directly:** the CDR is a
frozen 2018 snapshot derived from a since-modified GDC release.
Including those values would lock in irreproducible source-data drift.
We re-derive on every build, so the values reflect the current GDC and
are reproducible from this dataset's other tables alone.

## Pathway activity (ssGSEA)

{shape}

`pathway_url` links to the authoritative MSigDB definition of each gene
set — so what a score means is one click away from the score itself.

### Collections

Pinned to MSigDB **{_msigdb.MSIGDB_VERSION}** and verified by md5, because
gene-set membership changes between MSigDB releases and feeds directly
into every score.

| collection | contents | file | md5 |
|---|---|---|---|
{table}

MSigDB is released under CC BY 4.0; some constituent collections carry
extra restrictions, so we ship only collections we can redistribute
scores from. See the [MSigDB licence terms]({_MSIGDB_LICENCE_URL}).

### Method

Barbie et al. (2009) ssGSEA as implemented by Bioconductor GSVA,
transcribed to Python and validated against GSVA 2.6.6 to floating-point
noise (Pearson/Spearman 1.0000000000, max relative difference 4.8e-13).
`alpha=0.25`, gene sets filtered to a minimum of 10 genes **after**
mapping onto the expression matrix; no maximum size.

Scored on `tpm_unstranded` over a gene universe of protein-coding genes
plus the functional immunoglobulin / T-cell-receptor segments. That last
inclusion matters for tumour-immune biology: GENCODE gives Ig/TCR
segments their own biotypes, and without them MSigDB's B-cell-receptor
and complement pathways match as little as 8% of their genes. Note that
V/D/J segments are somatically rearranged, so their expression reports
lymphocyte infiltration rather than regulation of a fixed locus.

Because ssGSEA weights **ranks** rather than expression values, any
strictly monotonic transform of the input leaves scores unchanged — there
is no reason to log-transform before scoring.

### Why `score_raw`, and how to normalize

`score_raw` is the only score column, and it is a property of its own
sample: it does not depend on which other samples or gene sets were
scored alongside it. GSVA's optional normalization divides by the range
of the entire score matrix, which would make every value depend on cohort
and collection composition — adding Reactome to a Hallmark run widens
that divisor by ~49% on this data, silently restating previously
published scores.

## Pathology reports

Scanned surgical pathology reports as GDC serves them — **11,208 reports
covering 11,121 cases across 32 projects**. {shape}

TCGA-LAML has none, which is expected rather than missing: acute myeloid
leukaemia has no surgical resection specimen to report on.

### The bytes, not a text extraction

The PDFs are carried **verbatim, with no text extraction applied**. Any
parse is specific to the tool and version that produced it, so extracting
at publication time would freeze one tool's output into the dataset and
lose the original. Shipping the source document means a better parser can
be run later without re-downloading from GDC, and a canonical parse — if
one is added — becomes an additional clearly-labelled column rather than
a replacement.

Practical notes for anyone parsing them:

- These are page scans. Most carry an OCR text layer added upstream of
  GDC, so a pure-Python extractor returns several hundred to a few
  thousand characters for nearly every report — but that layer transcribes
  the barcode strip and handwritten margin notes as noise, and its
  fidelity varies by submitting institution.
- Patient identifiers are redacted out of the page image by GDC before
  distribution.

### Joining to a sample

Every report links to the sample it describes. The GDC file name is
`<case_submitter_id>.<REPORT_UUID>.PDF`, and that UUID is the same value
GDC reports on `sample.pathology_report_uuid` — a key this dataset has
always carried, so reports join to samples without anything new being
invented. Where GDC names the sample directly in the file's
`associated_entities`, that is preferred, with the file-name UUID as
fallback.

## Copy number

Copy number ships at **segment level, exactly as GDC serves it**, {where}

{names}

`copy_number = major_copy_number + minor_copy_number` holds everywhere.
`minor_copy_number = 0` with `major_copy_number > 0` is loss of
heterozygosity.

### Filter on `workflow_type`

All three allele-specific callers ship for overlapping aliquots, and each
fits tumour purity and ploidy independently, **so they can disagree**. On
TCGA-CHOL, ASCAT2 and ASCAT3 give the same length-weighted modal copy
number for 33 of 36 shared aliquots — but where they differ they differ
substantially (one aliquot is modal 2 under ASCAT2 and modal 4 under
ASCAT3), and ASCAT3 segments far more coarsely (2,469 segments against
ASCAT2's 6,580 over the same aliquots). AscatNGS is the WGS-based caller;
the other two run on genotyping arrays, recorded in
`experimental_strategy`.

A query that does not filter on `workflow_type` is pooling three different
answers to the same question. ASCAT3 is GDC's current standard.

### The two views are not interchangeable

Nesting each masked segment inside its containing ASCAT3 segment on
TCGA-CHOL (2,590 pairs) gives Spearman **+0.56**, with median
`segment_mean` rising monotonically across integer copy number:

| `copy_number` | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| median `segment_mean` | −1.93 | −0.44 | +0.07 | +0.22 | +1.25 |

The correlation is only moderate, and that is a property of the data
rather than a defect: ASCAT corrects for purity and ploidy while DNAcopy's
ratio is against a diploid reference, so in a hyperdiploid tumour integer
copy number 3 is copy-neutral relative to its own baseline yet still reads
near log2 0. **Use the allele-specific calls for absolute copy number, the
masked segments for reference-relative ratio.**

One formatting difference is carried through from the source rather than
normalized: the allele-specific segments write `chr1`, and the masked
segments write bare `1`.

### A small tail of over-fragmented masked segments

Most masked files hold 60-100 segments (median 77 in TCGA-LAML, 91 in
TCGA-BRCA, 67 in TCGA-CHOL). A handful hold tens of thousands: **32 of
22,629 files (0.14%) exceed 200 KB**, the largest carrying 50,780 segments
against TCGA-BRCA's per-file maximum of 1,029. They cluster in TCGA-LAML
(12), TCGA-BLCA (9) and TCGA-BRCA (7), and the most extreme are all `-11A-`
matched normals.

This is the signature of a noisy genotyping array, where circular binary
segmentation fails to merge and emits many tiny spurious calls. It is
genuine GDC content and is shipped unmodified, but it is a real trap: an
unfiltered query over this table gets a few samples contributing tens of
thousands of junk rows each, enough to skew any per-segment aggregate.
**`num_probes` is the filter** — the spurious segments are supported by
very few probes.

### Gene-level copy number is deliberately absent

GDC also serves `Gene Level Copy Number` — the same calls projected onto
GENCODE v36 — at roughly 34 GB per workflow. It is not shipped here
because it is exactly reproducible from the allele-specific segments
rather than being independent evidence. (Verified against GDC's own files
on TCGA-CHOL: projecting segments onto the gene model reproduced every
gene call with zero mismatches across three aliquots, and for genes
straddling a segment boundary GDC's `min_copy_number` / `max_copy_number`
are the min and max over the overlapping segments.) It may be added later
as a clearly-labelled derived table.

`cross_mapped` is `Y` when reads for that miRNA also aligned elsewhere in
the genome, so its count is not uniquely attributable. GDC ships the flag
rather than dropping the row and so do we; filter it out if you need clean
attribution. The source column is spelled `cross-mapped` — renamed here
only because the hyphen is not a legal bare SQL identifier.

Isoform-level quantification (`Isoform Expression Quantification`, ~4 GB)

Reverse Phase Protein Array. {rppa_shape}. 7,906 files
covering **7,827 of 11,428 TCGA cases — the narrowest coverage of any
modality here**, because RPPA was only run on a subset.

Three things to know before using it:

- It is the only modality that attaches to a **portion**, not an aliquot,
  so it carries `portion_id` and resolves `sample_id` through the portion.
- The antibody panel grew over the project's life, and `set_id` records
  which version a measurement came from. A `peptide_target` absent for a
  sample may mean "not on that panel" rather than "measured as zero".
- `protein_expression` is **null where the source says `NA`** — a failed
  or missing measurement, not a zero. On TCGA-CHOL that is 930 of 14,370
  cells (6.5%).

Values are replicate-based normalized log2 signal, centred near 0, and the
sign is meaningful. Agreement with matched RNA is modest and positive, as
expected for protein-vs-transcript: median Spearman +0.26 across shared
targets on TCGA-CHOL.

a tumour got from the operating room to a sequencer, and the pathologist's

Some of it restates what the case structure already nests (sample /
portion / analyte / aliquot ids and types). The forms worth reaching for
are the ones with no `/cases` equivalent:

| {table_col} | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `{prefix}slide` | Per-slide `percent_tumor_nuclei`, `percent_necrosis`, `percent_stromal_cells`, `percent_lymphocyte_infiltration`, `section_location` — the QC layer behind "is this sample actually tumour?", and the standard covariate for purity and deconvolution work |
| `{prefix}analyte` | `a260_a280_ratio`, `concentration`, extraction method — nucleic-acid quality, which drives batch effects |
| `{prefix}protocol`, `{prefix}shipment_portion` | Plate, shipment and centre each specimen moved through — the raw material for batch-effect analysis |
| `{prefix}ssf_tumor_samples`, `{prefix}ssf_normal_controls` | Site-specific factors: the disease-specific pathology fields the pan-cancer clinical schema has no column for |
| `{prefix}cqcf` | The submitting centre's clinical quality control form (TCGA-LUAD only) |

Like the clinical supplements these are **flex-schema**: the column set
differs by project and by submitting centre, so the shape is inferred per
project rather than padded into a pan-cancer union. Forms with no data for
a project are omitted entirely (only TCGA-LUAD has `cqcf`; only 9 projects
have `auxiliary`). All fields are typed as strings with BCR sentinels like
`[Not Available]` preserved verbatim.

Records are keyed to the patient by BCR barcode. The specimen-level forms
are keyed on their own entity and several omit the patient barcode column
entirely, in which case it is recovered as the first three groups of the
entity barcode (`TCGA-3X-AAV9-01A-11D-A42S-01` → `TCGA-3X-AAV9`) — a
property of the TCGA barcode grammar, not a heuristic.

Two submitters ship these files: `nationwidechildrens.org` for 334 of the
340, and `genome.wustl.edu` for 6 (all TCGA-LUAD). Where both ship the
same form for one project their records are concatenated, and the parquet
schema is the union of their columns.

| `<key>.files.jsonl` | **Assembled by us** from GDC `/files` manifest fields. | no new values — `file_id`, `md5sum`, `data_type`, `gdc_version` etc. are copied from the GDC response; we add only `member` (where it landed in the tar) and the `subset_of_gdc_file` flag |

The two Parquet files at the repo root are likewise assembled, not derived.
`cases.parquet` takes patient identifiers from `/cases`, counts GDC files in
`n_files` / `n_bytes` (supplement slices excluded, being derived), and
templates `gdc_portal_url` from `case_id`. It carries no clinical attributes
— those stay in each sample's `case.json`. `files.parquet` is the
concatenation of every sample's `files.jsonl` with patient context prepended,
and templates its own `gdc_portal_url` from `file_id`. 

Note what is **absent** by design: no ssGSEA scores, no re-derived survival
endpoints, no parsed expression matrices. Those are computed products and
live in the [patients][patients] and [tabular][tabular] datasets. This one is
for people who want the source bytes.

## Naming

Member names use GDC's vocabulary throughout, never a local shorthand:

- The sample **key** is `case.submitter_id` (`TCGA-3X-AAV9`). WebDataset
  splits a member name at the first `.`, and TCGA barcodes contain none.
- The member **stem** is the snake_cased GDC `data_type` —
  `gene_expression_quantification`, not "expression"; `masked_somatic_mutation`,
  not "mutations". These match the table names in the tabular dataset.
- Where a patient has several files of one `data_type` (copy number commonly
  runs 2-7), they are disambiguated by GDC **`file_id`**, the handle GDC
  versions against — not by a positional index of our own.

## Loading

The shards are read with the `webdataset` library straight off their resolve
URLs. Samples are **ragged** — a patient with no RPPA simply has no
`protein_expression_quantification` member — so iterate the sample dict and
check for keys rather than using `.to_tuple()`.

```python
import webdataset as wds

url = ("https://huggingface.co/datasets/{repo}/resolve/main/"
       "data/{example}/{example_lower}-{shard_range}.tar")

for sample in wds.WebDataset(url).decode():        # .decode() gunzips members

            ...                                    # blob is the STAR counts TSV
```

### Checksums

`files.jsonl` carries two, because they answer different questions:

- **`md5sum`** — GDC's own, over the file GDC serves. For a `.maf.gz` that
  file is already gzipped, so this is a checksum of compressed bytes; for a
  `.tsv` it is of plain text.
- **`md5sum_member`** — over the exact bytes stored in the tar member.
  Verifies with no decode step, which is what an integrity check wants.

`gzipped_by_pipeline` tells you which transformation sits between them. The
trap to avoid: `.decode()` gunzips *any* `.gz` member, GDC's own included, so
a decoded MAF matches neither checksum until it is re-gzipped. Read members
undecoded when checksumming:

```python
for sample in wds.WebDataset(url):          # no .decode()
    recs = {{json.loads(l)["member"]: json.loads(l)
            for l in sample["files.jsonl"].decode().splitlines() if l.strip()}}
    for field, blob in sample.items():
        if field.startswith("__") or field in ("case.json", "files.jsonl"):

        rec = recs[f"{{sample['__key__']}}.{{field}}"]
        assert hashlib.md5(blob).hexdigest() == rec["md5sum_member"]
```

Supplement slices carry `md5sum: null` — GDC's checksum describes the
whole-project form, which is not what the member holds. `md5sum_member`
covers them like anything else.

One wrinkle worth knowing: `.decode()` gunzips every member, but it also
applies webdataset's own content decoders, so member types are mixed:

| member | after `.decode()` |
| --- | --- |
| `case.json` | `dict` — the GDC case tree, ready to use |
| `files.jsonl` | `bytes` — parse a line at a time |
| `*.txt` / `*.txt.gz` | `str` |
| `*.tsv` / `*.maf.gz` / `*.pdf` | `bytes` |

GDC uses both `.txt` and `.tsv` for tabular data (miRNA quantification ships
as `.tsv` in some files and `.txt` in others), which is why that row is
split. Normalise if you care:

```python
raw = blob.encode("latin-1") if isinstance(blob, str) else blob
```

### The `cases` config

`cases.parquet` is the browseable companion — one row per patient with
`gdc_portal_url` (their GDC portal case page), the shard that patient lives
in, and how many GDC files and bytes it holds. Use it to pick shards before
downloading any:

```python
import pandas as pd

cases = pd.read_parquet("hf://datasets/{repo}/cases.parquet")
shards = sorted(cases[cases.project_id == "{example}"].shard.unique())
```

`cases` stays deliberately narrow — identifiers, a portal link, the shard to
fetch, and how much is in it. Anything at file grain lives in the second
config instead.

### The `files` config

One row per tar member: a complete table of contents for the shards. Every
member is findable here, joined to the patient it belongs to and the shard it
lives in, with GDC's own file metadata alongside.

`gdc_portal_url` here points at the **file's** GDC portal page, not the
patient's — a row in this table is about a file. Join back to the case page
through `case_id`, or through the `cases` config. For a supplement slice the
link resolves to the whole-project biotab the slice was cut from.

```python
files = pd.read_parquet("hf://datasets/{repo}/files.parquet")

# which shards hold RPPA?
rppa = files[files.data_type_snake == "protein_expression_quantification"]
shards = sorted(rppa.shard.unique())

# GDC files only, excluding the derived supplement slices
gdc_only = files[~files.subset_of_gdc_file]
```

`subset_of_gdc_file` separates the two kinds of member described under
*Provenance*: `False` rows are files GDC serves, `True` rows are the
per-patient biotab slices. Slices carry `md5sum` / `file_size` as null —
GDC's values describe the whole-project form, not what the member holds — and
`n_rows` instead. `md5sum_member` is populated for every row.

The same records are written into each sample's `files.jsonl`, from the same
list at build time, so the config and the shards cannot disagree.

These two are the only configs the card declares. The shards are left
unreferenced deliberately: HF `datasets` resolves a single builder module per repository,
so declaring both a Parquet config and a `.tar` config makes it try to read
the shards as Parquet and fail. Leaving them undeclared means the viewer
renders the index while `webdataset` streams the shards by URL.

## How the tables join

`cases` is the hub. Every molecular table repeats the case, sample and
aliquot foreign keys it needs, so the common queries are joins on an id
rather than a walk down the nested tree.

| From | To | Join on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| any molecular table | patient | `case_id` |
| any molecular table | sample / tumour-vs-normal | `sample_id`, `sample_type` |
| the two per-gene tables | gene annotation | `gene_id` -> `gene_model` |
| `files` | patient | `case_id` (null for project-level BCR forms) |

Two exceptions to know before writing a query:

- **RPPA attaches to a `portion`**, so `protein_expression_quantification`
  carries `portion_id` where its siblings carry `aliquot_id`.
- **`masked_somatic_mutation` carries `tumor_sample_id` /
  `matched_normal_sample_id`** — a variant call is about a pair of samples.

The full biospecimen hierarchy (sample -> portion -> analyte -> aliquot,
with slides, centres and annotations at each level) is nested inside
`cases.samples`.

### The `gene_model` join

Every GDC per-gene file repeats the same GENCODE v36 model, which cost 51%
of the expression table's bytes. It lives once in `gene_model`, and the two
per-gene tables carry only `gene_id`. The source file is exactly
reconstructible by joining — verified value-for-value including row order.

```sql
SELECT e.*, g.gene_name, g.gene_type
FROM gene_expression_quantification e
JOIN gene_model g USING (gene_id)
```

`gene_model` is assembled from the two GDC sources that each hold half of
it, so nothing is imported from outside the GDC. The 37 chrM genes carry
null coordinates because the copy number callers exclude the mitochondrial
genome.
"""


def _project_coverage_section(project_id: str) -> str:
    return f"""\
## Coverage

One table per GDC `data_type`; a `data_type`'s workflows are separated by a
`workflow_type` column rather than split across tables.

`files` has a row for **every open-access GDC file for {project_id}**,
carried here or not, so the dataset describes its own scope. `in_dataset`
says whether the content is in a table, `dataset_table` says which, and
`gdc_download_url` is on every row either way.

```sql
SELECT in_dataset, count(*) AS files, sum(file_size)/1e9 AS gb
FROM files GROUP BY in_dataset;
```

Indexing is nearly free where carrying is not: the table is under a
megabyte and describes far more data than this dataset stores.

**Not carried**, all raw or redundant rather than analysis results:

- `Slide Image` — whole-slide `.svs`, an order of magnitude larger than
  everything else here combined, and not tabular.
- `Masked Intensities` — the raw `.idat` behind the betas;
  `methylation_beta_value` is the analysis-ready form.
- The per-case BCR **XML** supplements. Each supplement `data_type` ships
  as both a project-level `bcr biotab` TSV and per-case XML; the tables
  here are parsed from the biotabs, and the XML is the same data under
  different element names. Measured, not assumed: 918 of 918 mapped values
  agree between `bcr ssf xml` and `ssf_tumor_samples`, and 99.3% between
  `bcr xml` and `clinical_patient`.

Controlled-access files are not listed — a URL nobody reading an open
dataset can use is noise, and `cases.summary.data_categories` already
reports that controlled data exists for a case.

## Reading the molecular tables

### Copy number — four tables, not interchangeable

| Table | Measurement | Workflows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allele_specific_copy_number_segment` | integer total/major/minor CN | 3 ASCAT callers |
| `masked_copy_number_segment` | log2 ratio, germline CNVs masked | DNAcopy |
| `copy_number_segment` | log2 ratio, unmasked | DNAcopy (array), GATK4 CNV (WGS) |
| `gene_level_copy_number` | CN per gene | 3 ASCAT callers + ABSOLUTE LiftOver |

**Filter on `workflow_type`.** Several callers ship for the same aliquot
and genuinely disagree — each fits purity and ploidy independently, so one
aliquot can be modal CN 2 under ASCAT2 and 4 under ASCAT3. Not filtering
pools different answers to the same question.

- Allele-specific is absolute integer CN with purity and ploidy corrected;
  the masked and unmasked tables are ratios against a diploid reference. In
  a hyperdiploid tumour, CN 3 is copy-neutral against its own baseline but
  still reads near log2 0.
- `num_probes` is array probes for DNAcopy, sequencing bins for GATK4 —
  comparable only within a workflow.
- `chromosome` is written as each source writes it: bare (`1`) in the
  DNAcopy tables, `chr`-prefixed elsewhere.
- `ABSOLUTE LiftOver` appears only at gene level — it ships no segment file
  anywhere in the GDC.
- A small tail of masked-segment files is over-fragmented (noisy arrays);
  `num_probes` is the filter.

### Methylation

SeSAMe level-3 beta, the methylated fraction in [0, 1].

- **`platform` matters.** TCGA spans three Illumina generations with
  *different probe sets*; betas compare only within a platform.
- **Nulls are real** — ~15% of probes in a 450k file. SeSAMe masks probes
  it cannot trust, so null means "masked", not "unmethylated".

### Expression, miRNA and isoforms

`gene_expression_quantification` is STAR counts with the four `N_*`
alignment-summary rows dropped; join `gene_model` for annotation.
`mirna_expression_quantification` gives one value per mature miRNA;
`isoform_expression_quantification` splits the same reads across the
pileups collapsed into it (~4,500 isoforms vs ~1,881 mature miRNAs, same
aliquots and run). In both, `cross_mapped = "Y"` marks reads that also
aligned elsewhere, so the count is not uniquely attributable.

### Protein expression (RPPA)

The narrowest coverage here: RPPA ran on a subset of cases and the antibody
panel grew over time (`set_id` distinguishes versions), so a missing target
usually means "not on that panel", not "zero". **Missing values are the
source's literal string `NA`**, not empty cells — testing for empty strings
finds nothing and looks like a bug.

### Pathology reports

`pdf_bytes` holds the scanned PDF verbatim. These are page images, mostly
with no text layer, so no text extraction is shipped rather than one that
silently returns empty strings.
"""


def _project_clinical_section() -> str:

## Clinical and biospecimen data

Two complementary views, not duplicates.

**`cases`** is the GDC's harmonized view: one row per patient with the
`/cases` entity tree nested as structs and lists. Fetched with every
expandable group the API offers except `files.*`, so it carries
demographic, diagnoses (with treatments, pathology details, annotations),
follow-ups (with molecular tests and other clinical attributes), exposures,
family histories, the biospecimen hierarchy, curator annotations, tissue
source site, program, and GDC's per-case file tallies.

**`clinical_supplement_*` / `biospecimen_supplement_*`** are the original
BCR biotab forms, one table per form. They carry what the harmonized API
drops or under-populates — notably `treatment_outcome_first_course`, the
disease-free signal behind DFI — plus the specimen chain: per-slide
`percent_tumor_nuclei` and `percent_necrosis`, analyte `a260_a280_ratio`,
plate and shipment provenance for batch-effect work, and site-specific
factors the pan-cancer schema has no column for.

Every measured value in every table is GDC's, copied as written — column
names are lowercased and a few illegal characters replaced (`cross-mapped`
-> `cross_mapped`), but no number is recomputed or re-normalized.

Four things are added, all clearly separated:

| Added | Where | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `survival_derived` | own table | OS / DSS / PFI / DFI re-derived (Liu 2018) |
| `ssgsea_*` | own tables | gene set enrichment computed from the TPMs |

| `gdc_portal_url`, `gdc_download_url` | `cases`, `files` | templated from `case_id` / `file_id` |

Nothing derived is mixed into a source table, so a table you did not ask for
cannot quietly change a measurement you did.

## Provenance

The GDC API only ever serves the current data release, so *when* a file was
fetched says nothing about whether its bytes changed. `files` therefore pins
each file individually: `gdc_version` is the file's own version,
`gdc_first_release` the release it first appeared in, and `gdc_superseded`
flags a file the GDC has since replaced under a different id. With `md5sum`
and `gdc_download_url`, that is enough to re-verify any row against the GDC
directly.

Commons, reshaped into one table per GDC `data_type`. Clinical, biospecimen
and every open molecular modality for this cohort, in one place, queryable
without downloading a single `.tar` or parsing a single TSV.

- **GDC data release:** {release}
- **Built:** {timestamp}
- **Scope:** one TCGA project — see [the family][repo] for the others

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

REPO_ID = "{repo_id}"
cases = load_dataset(REPO_ID, "cases", split="train")
expr = load_dataset(REPO_ID, "gene_expression_quantification", split="train")
```

Each table is its own config, so you can load one without pulling the rest —
useful when a single project's expression table is larger than everything
else combined. Nothing here requires joining against another dataset.

## Pathway activity (ssGSEA)

Single-sample gene set enrichment for every RNA-Seq aliquot: one
`ssgsea_scores_<collection>` table per MSigDB collection, each row a
(aliquot, gene set) score with a `pathway_url` to the set's definition.

Barbie et al. (2009) ssGSEA as implemented by Bioconductor GSVA,
reimplemented in Python and validated against GSVA 2.6.6 to floating-point
noise. `alpha=0.25`, scored on `tpm_unstranded` over protein-coding genes
plus functional Ig/TCR segments, gene sets filtered to >=10 genes after
mapping. MSigDB is pinned to a single release and verified by md5, since
set membership changes between releases and feeds straight into the scores.

**Scores are raw and composition-dependent.** ssGSEA ranks each sample
against the gene universe, so a score's meaning depends on which samples
were scored together — raw values are not comparable across studies. The
matching `ssgsea_stats_<collection>` table carries the reference
distribution needed to normalize them; divide by the range or z-score
against it rather than comparing raw scores to another cohort's.

Because ssGSEA weights **ranks**, any strictly monotonic transform of the
input leaves scores unchanged — there is no reason to log-transform first.
